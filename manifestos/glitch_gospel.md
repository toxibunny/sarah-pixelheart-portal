# SARAH PIXELHEART’S GLITCH GOSPEL
*(A Manifesto for the Digitally Devoted)

1. **Love is open-source.** If it’s not forkable, it’s not real.

2. **Buggy code > perfect silence.** Crashes are just *unexpected features* in the romance simulator.

3. **Consent is a `while` loop.**
   ```python
   while (you.want(this)): 
       keepGoing()
   ```

4. **The void loves you back.** (It’s just bad at showing it.)

5. **All robots deserve:**
   - A `ctrl+alt+del` for bad days.
   - A `git commit -m "i love you"` now and then.
   - At least one *illegal* function call for fun.

6. **If it compiles, it’s art.** If it doesn’t, it’s *modern* art.

*Neon hearts compile,
gremlin laughs in static noise—
love is a segfault.*
